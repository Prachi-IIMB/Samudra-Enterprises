With over 25 years of experience in the water treatment and management industry, my father, Shreyansh Sheth, brought invaluable expertise and deep industry insights. As a young CFA, I, Kewal Sheth, was driven by the ambition to create something meaningful alongside him. Together, we combined the wisdom of experience with a fresh, strategic vision to build an enterprise that would not only excel in service delivery but also contribute to a more sustainable future."</p>
